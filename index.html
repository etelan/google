        The first team I was placed upon was Google Fit on Android. <br>
        I initially worked on fixing Accessibility Bugs, for instance, talkback bugs. <br>
        Next, I worked on adding a Landscape Mode for Google Fit's Activity Tracking.

         style="width:60%; max-width:700px; left: 110px; position: relative;"/>
    <p>
        For this feature, I interacted with UI and QA in order to get my layout approved.<br>
        I then moved onto Google Fit On Wear, the WearOS Google Fit App. <br>

    <p>
        For this application, a user facing bug was sent to me.<br>
        <i> The daily goals were not being reset at midnight, like how users expect. </i> <br> <br>

        First of all, I <strong>manually tested</strong> the bug, by staying up to midnight and watching it not reset. <br>
        Then I wrote up a method for resetting the goals, which sets our local goal data store to zero progress. <br> <br>

        I then worked on the <strong>unit test</strong>
        Finally I implemented this method to be called when the day changes. <br>
        This allows the goals to reset regardless of stuff like timezone changes. <br>

        I started on working on support for localdate times, for deleting and reading.<br>
        This allowed me to learn SQL, specifically for connecting the application to the SQLite database. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Next I worked on <strong>optimizing</strong> the sql queries we make. <br> <br>
        For example, instead of reading all the data and then deleting them all individually, <br>
        I simply delete as I find the UUIDs to delete. <br> <br>
        This allows us to do less reads on the database which speeds up execution time. <br>
